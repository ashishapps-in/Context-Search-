- Make sure you're highlighting more than 1 character
- Check if you're on a restricted page (chrome:// pages don't allow extensions)

**Context menu not showing?**
- Right-click the extension icon → Check permissions
- Reload the extension from chrome://extensions/

**Translation not working?**
- Check your internet connection
- Try again (there may be rate limits on the unofficial API)
